Experiment Plan:  SeriationCT and SAA2015 Paper
===============================================

## Abstract ##

>At scales where individual copying events are not measurable but the regional archaeological record is rich enough to support models more detailed than phylogenies, seriation can play a unique role as a diachronic measurement tool for linking cultural transmission models to data composed of assemblages of artifact class frequencies. As a first step towards fitting cultural transmission models to regional-scale transmission scenarios, we develop a iterative deterministic seriation algorithm.  We then implement summary statistics suitable for fitting models to seriations using an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach.
