Composed of:

* 4 clusters, 0.1 interconnect, 10 nodes per cluster
* Even lower mutation and also modifying migrationfraction downward.  

Let's see if the trend of p-values improving holds...

    "theta_low": 0.00001,
    "theta_high": 0.00005,
    "migrationfraction_low" : 0.005,
    "migrationfraction_high" : 0.01,
