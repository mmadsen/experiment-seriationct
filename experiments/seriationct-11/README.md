# seriationct-11 #

Composed of:

* 5 slices
* distance/minmax model
* moderate migration fraction (migr = 0.05 to 0.2)
* moderate innovation rate (theta = 0.001 to 0.01
* overlap between slices 0.1 
* density of nodes 0.1

identical to seriationct-10 except half the nodes (density 0.1) so a sample of 10-12
assemblages will be double the sample fraction of the simulated population. 

Does that matter?  Were we getting too sparse a sample in seriationct-9 and 10?
